# AI-Based-Recommender-System-For-Hospitals

The primary goal of this research is to
develop a scheduling recommender system for Fanous
Clinic, USA, aimed at optimizing the appointment
scheduling process based on disease reports generated
from the clinic's mobile application. The system
recommends the type of visit required, categorizing it as
a Primary Care visit alone, with a consultant, with a
pharmacist, or with both. The system was developed
using Python and the random forest algorithm.

Data for training and evaluation was sourced from
Fanous Clinic, USA. Our results demonstrate that the
model effectively reduces the workload and time
required by Primary Care physicians to review patient
reports, allowing them to make more efficient and
accurate scheduling decisions.

The implementation of this scheduling recommender
system offers significant practical benefits, including
time savings for healthcare providers and expedited
scheduling processes for patients, thus improving the
overall efficiency and effectiveness of clinic operations.
